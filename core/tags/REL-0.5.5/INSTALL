JVoiceXML
=========

Requirements
------------

JVoiceXML uses features of J2SE 1.5 and will not run with versions below.
Optional: ANT 1.7 to run the demos

JVoiceXML Installation
----------------------

Using the installer (Windows and Linux):

Simply unzip jvxml-<version>.zip to extract the installer jar archive.
Become root on Linux machines.
Call
java -jar jvxml-<version>-install.jar
to install the JVoiceXML voice browser.

Alternatively, a double-click on the jar should do on Windows.

Using the rpm (Linux):

Become root and call
rpm -ivh jvoicexml-<version>.rpm


The installation folder is referred as JVOICEXML_HOME


Start the VoiceXML browser
--------------------------

On Linux:

sh $JVOICEXML_HOME/bin/startup.sh

On Windows

Doubleclick:

%JVOICEXML_HOME%/bin/JVoiceXML.exe
or
%JVOICEXML_HOME%/bin/startup.bat


Test the VoiceXML browser
-------------------------

JVoiceXML comes with a couple of demos, which can be used to test the browser.

To run the demos, create a file jvoicexml.properties in the JVOICEXML_HOME
directory with the following contents

3rdparty.dir=../../lib
log4j.lib.dir=../../lib
jvoicexml.lib.dir=../../lib

This tells the build scripts where to find the libraries that are required
to compile and run the demos.

In most cases it should be sufficient to change to each demo directory
and call

ant run
