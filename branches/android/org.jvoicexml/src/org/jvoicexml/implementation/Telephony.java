/**
 * Telephony support.
 *
 * <p>
 * Objects that implement this interface are able to support making a third
 * party connection through a communications network, such as the telephone.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In fact this is a bridge to use speech synthesis (via
 * {@link SynthesizedOutput} and spoken input (via {@link SpokenInput} on a
 * client, which may be a PBX.
 * Hence, it is able to handle the communication between the client and the
 * JVoiceXML server.
 * The architecture is kept open at this point so that it is also possible
 * to hook other clients, like the console or a PDA.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is guaranteed that the session remains the same between the calls to
 * {@link org.jvoicexml.RemoteConnectable#connect(org.jvoicexml.ConnectionInformation)} and
 * {@link org.jvoicexml.RemoteConnectable#disconnect(org.jvoicexml.ConnectionInformation)}.
 * </p>
