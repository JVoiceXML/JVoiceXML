\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

JVoiceXML is a free VoiceXML~\cite{w3.org:voicexml} implementation written in 
the JAVA programming language. It offers a library for easy VoiceXML
document creation and a VoiceXML interpreter to process 
VoiceXML documents using JAVA standard API's such as JSAPI~\cite{sun:jsapi} and
JTAPI~\cite{sun:jtapi}.

JVoiceXML is hosted at SourceForge~\cite{sourceforge} as an open source 
project.
You find everything that is related to this project under
\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvoicexml/}.

This document describes the architecture of JVoiceXML version 0.5.5. The
architecture of JVoiceXML follows
consequently the proposed architecture of~\cite{w3.org:voicexml}.
Some parts of this specification are copied into this document
but are not explicitly marked.
Since JVoiceXML is written in JAVA, standard JAVA API's are supported as a base
implementation. JSAPI~\cite{sun:jsapi}, the \textbf{J}AVA \textbf{S}peech
\textbf{API}, is used for speech input and output,
and JTAPI~\cite{sun:jtapi}, the \textbf{J}AVA \textbf{T}elephony \textbf{API}, is used for the 
telephony issues. 
A basic layer supporting these APIs is part of the default distribution (JTAPI
support is currently not implemented) to have a default implementation for the
custom interfaces to speech recognition and telephony. This
also means, that JVoiceXML can be easily adapted to custom speech recognizers,
text-to-speech engines and telephony platforms as long as they
are compliant to these JAVA API's.

Nobody is perfect, so you may find some errors or small things to correct.
Please let me know if you think you found something that should we written
differently or should be added.

\textbf{Note: } This document is not complete, probably it never will. It can
give you a basic understanding of the concepts and ideas behind JVoiceXML. It
is published in the hope, that it will be somehow helpful.
Unfortunately, you still have to do some code analysis to understand, what's
really going on.

\section{Application description}
\label{sec:appl-descr}

\subsection{Component overview}
\label{sec:component-overview}

The overall architecture is shown in the following figure.
It follows the proposed architectural model of~\cite{w3.org:voicexml}, 
section~1.2.1. 
\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{maincomponents}}
\end{center}

The architecture consists of three main components:
\begin{enumerate}
\item document server,
\item VoiceXML interpreter context including the VoiceXML interpreter and
\item implementation platform.
\end{enumerate}

At the implementation platform component side, the VoiceXML interpreter can be
used to process your VoiceXML documents, independent if you were using the 
VoiceXML document library, using hooks based on JSAPI and JTAPI.
This makes the interpreter vendor independent, as long these standards
are supported.

The components have a direct impact on the package structure, which is shown
in the following figure.

\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{corepackagestructure}}
\end{center}

Each of the components named above has a corresponding part as a package in the
namespace \texttt{org.jvoicexml}. 
\begin{description}
\item[documentserver] Implementation of the document server,
\item[interpreter] Implementation of the VoiceXML interpreter and
\item[implementation] Implementation of the implementation 
platform.
\end{description}

Besides, there are some utility packages:
\begin{description}
\item[application] Representation of applications.
\item[config] Handle configuration issues.
\item[logging] Handle logging issues.
\item[xml] Enable parsing and creation of VoiceXML documents.
\item[event] Define events that can be thrown by all of the 
other components and are caught by the center component \emph{VoiceXML
Interpreter Context}.
\item[jndi] Enable remote access to the interpreter.
\end{description}

The main package \texttt{org.jvoicexml} contains the interfaces and classes
which serve as an entry point for VoiceXML interpretation.

\subsection{Main Component}
\label{sec:main-component}

The classes and interfaces of the package \texttt{org.jvoicexml} serve as an
entry point for VoiceXML interpretation. This includes resource and session
management.
It contains the core interface \texttt{JVoiceXML} which serves
as the main entry point to access the interpreter. 

\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{maininterfaces}}
\end{center}

\texttt{JVoiceXml} serves a a \texttt{Session} factory and is responsible
for resource management. In addition this interfaces gives access to the other
components, like \emph{Document Server}, \emph{Implementation Platform}, and
\emph{Application Registry}. These are described in more detail in the following
section.

\subsection{Client View}
\label{sec:client-view}

The VoiceXML specification leaves it undefined, how clients can connect to the
VoiceXML interpreter. Normally this happens using a telephone where the VoiceXML
interpreter answers the user's call. The hook to the telephony environment is
shown in the following diagram.

\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{clientview}}
\end{center}

The interfaces \texttt{RemoteClient} and \texttt{RemoteConnectable} are used to
connect the resource instances speech recognition, speech synthesis, and
telephony to a client, with JVoiceXML being the mediator.

This approach is very simple, but allows for a high flexibility. In fact are
there no assumptions, about the location of the resource instances.

\section{Detailed Component Description}
\label{sec:deta-comp-descr}

This section contains a more detailed description of the main components as they
are described in section~\ref{sec:appl-descr}.

\subsection{Document Server Component}
\label{sec:docum-serv-comp}

\subsubsection{Task of the Component}

This is the realization of the \emph{Document Server} component. It can be found
in the package \texttt{org.jvoicexml.documentserver}.

The main purpose of the \texttt{DocumentServer} is to process requests from a 
client application.

The document server evaluates the scheme of the incoming requests and
calls the appropriate \texttt{SchemeStrategy} to create VoiceXML
documents in response. Each document can be identified uniquely by
it's URI~\cite{w3.org:addressing}.

This implementation of a document server is only responsible for
evaluating the scheme selection of the corresponding document repository,
e.g. a web server.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}

As shown in the following class diagram, a \texttt{DocumentServer}
knows multiple \emph{SchemeStrategies}.

\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{documentserver}}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Interfaces of the Component}

All functionality that is relevant for the VoiceXML interpreter can be accessed
through the \texttt{DocumentServer} interface, that is part of the main package.

The implementation of the \texttt{Document\-Server} holds a set od
\texttt{Scheme\-Strategies} to handle requests for a specific scheme.
All supported schems must implement the \texttt{Scheme\-Strategy} interface to be
handled by the \texttt{Docu\-ment\-Server}.

\subsection{VoiceXML Interpreter Component}
\label{sec:voic-interpr-comp}

\subsubsection{Task of the Component}

This is the realization of the 
\emph{VoiceXML Interpreter Context} and the \emph{VoiceXML Interpreter}
component. It processes VoiceXML documents retrieved from the
\texttt{DocumentServer}.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}

The core interfaces and classes of the interpreter are shown in the following
class diagramm.

\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{interpreter}}
\end{center}

After the retrieval of a VoiceXML document from the \texttt{Document\-Server}, the
\texttt{VoiceXml\-Interpreter\-Context} delegates the interpretation of the VoiceXML
document to the \texttt{VoiceXmlInterpreter}. Then it asks the 
\texttt{FormInterpretation\-Algorithm} to process the next form.

\subsubsection{Interfaces of the Component}

\subsection{Implementation Platform Component}
\label{sec:impl-platf-comp}

\subsubsection{Task of the Component}

This is the realization of the \emph{Implementation Platform}
component.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}

The main classes and interfaces of this component are shown in the follwing
class diagramm.

\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{implementation}}
\end{center}

The \texttt{ImplementationPlatformFactory} is a factory for
\texttt{Im\-ple\-men\-tation\-Plat\-form}s which are held in a pool.
This is currently not implemented, but will be realized as soon as possible.
Currently there is only one member in the pool.
The main class of the implementation platform component is 
\texttt{Im\-ple\-men\-tat\-ion\-Plat\-form} which is held in a pool of 
implementation
platforms by the \texttt{Im\-plementat\-ionPlat\-form\-Factory}. This means
that each session owns exactly one \texttt{Im\-plemen\-tat\-ionPlat\-form}
object.

The \texttt{ImplementationPlatform} provides access to the resources that are
needed for a VoiceXML application:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item speech synthesis through \texttt{SystemOutput},
  \item speech recognition through \texttt{UserInput}, and
  \item telephony through \texttt{CallControl}.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{implementationplatform}}
\end{center}
These resource interfaces are wrappers that have to be implemented to hook onto
the VoiceXML interpreter. As a basic implementation a JSAPI compliant
implementation for \texttt{SystemOutput} and \texttt{UserInput} is part of the
delivery. These prototypes serve two goals
\begin{enumerate}
  \item provide an ad-hoc implementation for JSAPI compliant speech synthesizers
  and speech recognizers and
  \item provide a demo implementation that can be used as a basis for custom
  implementations. 
\end{enumerate}
Later on, we will also provide a JTAPI compliant implementation with a similar
focus for the \texttt{CallControl}.

\subsubsection{Interfaces of the Component}

\subsection{Application Component}

\subsubsection{Task of the Component}

An \texttt{Application} is a set of documents sharing the same 
application root document.

Whenever the user interacts with a document in an application, its
application root document is also loaded. The application root document
remains loaded while the user is transitioning between other documents in the
same application, and it is unloaded when the user transitions to a document
that is not in the application. While it is loaded, the application root
document's variables are available to the other documents as application
variables, and its grammars remain active for the duration of the
application.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}

The main classes and interfaces of this component are shown in the following
class diagram.

\begin{center}
\rotatebox{-90}{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{implementation}}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Interfaces of the Component}

\subsection{Configuration Component}
\label{sec:conf-comp}

\subsubsection{Task of the Component}

This component contains classes to allow for easy access to the configuration
files.

There is currently one configuration file called \emph{jvoicexml.xml}
which is expected to be in the root directory of the classpath.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}

The central instance of this component is the class
\texttt{JVoiceXml\-Configurat\-ion} which encapsulates access to the
configuration file.

All configurable objects must implement the \texttt{Configurable}
interface. Thus, the individual components are responsible for
evaluating the configuration file.

\subsubsection{Interfaces of the component}

\subsection{Logging Component}
\label{sec:logging-component}

\subsubsection{Task of the Component}

This component contains classes to handle logging mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}

\subsubsection{Interfaces of the component}

\subsection{XML Component}
\label{sec:xml-component}

\subsubsection{Task of Component}

This package contains classes for easy creation and parsing of VoiceXML
documents.

VoiceXML is designed for creating audio dialogs that feature synthesized
speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF key input, recording
of spoken input, telephony and mixed initiative conversations. Its major goal
is to bring the advantages of web-based development and content delivery to
interactive voice response applications.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}


\subsubsection{Interfaces of the Component}

\subsection{Event Component}
\label{sec:event-component}

\subsubsection{Task of the Component}

The \texttt{ImplementationPlatform} throws events when the user does not 
respond, doesn't respond in a way that the application understands, requests 
help, etc. The interpreter
throws events if it finds a semantic error in a VoiceXML document, or when it
encounters a \texttt{<throw>} element. Events are identified by
character strings.

\subsubsection{Structure of the Component}

Events are subdivided into plain events, things that happen normally, and
error events, abnormal occurrences.

In addition, there are two basic event classes, which are derived from
a general \texttt{JVoiceXMLEvent}.

\subsubsection{Interfaces of the Component}

\section{Detailed Module Description}
\label{sec:deta-module-descr}

\subsection{Module Resource Management of the main component}

\texttt{JVoiceXml} is the main object and is responsible to instantiate and
acquire all needed resources. It is implemented as the GoF's creational
pattern Singleton\cite{gamma:design_patterns}. References
can only be retrieved by calling it's static \texttt{getInstance()} method.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{seq-jvoicexml-startup.eps}
\end{center}

On startup this central object instantiates all needed resources:

\begin{itemize}
\item the implementation platform factory,
\item the document server and
\item the application registry.
\end{itemize}

It also offers methods to access the document server and the application
registry.

The implementation platform factory instantiates and configures all
resources related the platform, like \texttt{SystemOutput} and
\texttt{UserInput} as shown in the following sequence diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{seq-implementation.eps}
\end{center}

\subsection{Module Session management of the main component}

\texttt{JVoiceXml} is a \texttt{Session} factory\cite{gamma:design_patterns}. 
Sessions are the heart of a user session, while working with the VoiceXML 
interpreter.

The following sequence diagram shows, how a session is retrieved
from the main component.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{seq-jvoicexml-sessionfactory.eps}
\end{center}

If the \texttt{Session} is not used any more, the allocated resources
can be returned by calling the \texttt{close()} method.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{seq-jvoicexml-sessionclose.eps}
\end{center}

\subsection{Module Document Retrieval of the Document Server component}
\label{sec:module-docum-serv}

The document server uses the strategy pattern~\cite{gamma:design_patterns} 
to process the different schemes.
Each instance of the \texttt{SchemeStrategy} interface knows how
to handle a specific URI scheme.

The anatomy of a call to the \texttt{DocumentServer} to retrieve a
document by it's URI is shown in the following sequence diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{seq-documentserver.eps}
\end{center}

\subsection{Module Form Interpretation Algorithm of the VoiceXML Interpreter 
component}
\label{sec:module-form-interpr}

The implementation of the \texttt{FormInterpretationAlgorithm} 
follows the description given in~\cite{w3.org:voicexml} section 2.1.6
and Appendix C.

The VoiceXML specification~\cite{w3.org:voicexml} names two main
functions of the form interpretation algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialization phase and
\item main loop.
\end{enumerate}

They are called from the \texttt{VoiceXmlInterpreter} as shown in the
following sequence diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{seq-interpreter-fia.eps}
\end{center}

The \emph{Initialization phase} is called whenever a form is entered.
Internal prompt counter variables (in the form's dialog scope) are reset to 1.
Each variable (form-level \texttt{<var>} elements and form item variables) is 
initialized, in document order, to undefined or to the value of the relevant 
\texttt{expr} attribute.

This is implemented with the help of \texttt{InitializationStrategy}s.
When the \texttt{ForminterpretationAlgorithm} initialization comes to a 
VoiceXML tag, it asks the \texttt{InitializationStrategyFactory} for a strategy
how to initialize the current node. If a matching strategy was found, the
\texttt{execute()} method of the returned \texttt{InitializationStrategy}
is called, as shown in the following sequence diagram:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{seq-interpreter-fia-initialize.eps}
\end{center}

The \emph{main loop} of the FIA, the \textbf{f}orm \textbf{i}nterpretation
\textbf{a}lgorithm, has three phases:

\begin{description}
\item[select phase] the next unfilled form item is selected for visiting.
\item[collect phase] the selected form item is visited, which prompts the user
for input, enables the appropriate grammars, and then waits for and collects 
an input (such as a spoken phrase or DTMF key presses) or an event 
(such as a request for help or a no input timeout).
\item[process phase] an input is processed by filling form items and executing
\texttt{<filled>} elements to perform actions such as input validation.
An event is processed by executing the appropriate event handler for that 
event type.
\end{description}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{seq-interpreter-fia-mainloop.eps}
\end{center}

The processing of the \texttt{FormItem}s in the collect phase
is implemented using the \emph{Visitor Pattern}.
The different kinds of form items, as described in section 2.1.2 
of~\cite{w3.org:voicexml} have their expression in subclassing the
\texttt{FormItem} as shown in the following class diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{class-interpreter-formitem.eps}
\end{center}

An overview, how the visitor is implemented is given in the following
class diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{class-interpreter-visitor.eps}
\end{center}

\subsection{Module ImplementationPlatform of the implementation platform 
component}


\subsection{Module VarRegistry of the VoiceXML Interpreter component}
\label{sec:module-varr-voic}

\subsection{Module Grammar Handler of the 
VoiceXML Interpreter component}

\subsection{Module ApplicationRegistry of the application component}

Registry for all known applications. All applications are identified
uniquely by their id.

The application registry allows for easy access to an application,
if only the id of the application is known. This may be used e.g. to
create a simple mapping from a a telephone line to the URI of the
application's root document.
