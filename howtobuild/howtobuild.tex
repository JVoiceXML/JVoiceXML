to build JVoiceXML or develop code for the JVoiceXML project. It gives
information about the requirements of your development environment 
and our coding conventions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

JVoiceXML is a free VoiceXML~\cite{w3.org:voicexml} implementation written in 
the JAVA programming language. It offers a library for easy VoiceXML
document creation and a VoiceXML interpreter to process 
VoiceXML documents using JAVA standard APIs such as JSAPI~\cite{sun:jsapi} and
JTAPI~\cite{sun:jsapi}.

VoiceXML was previously hosted at SourceForge~\cite{sourceforge} as an open source project.
You find everything that is related to this project under
\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvoicexml/}. Now, the code hase been made
available at GitHub at \url{https://github.com/JVoiceXML/JVoiceXML}.

This document refers to UNIX and Windows systems. JVoiceXML will work 
any other operating systems that support Java 8, too.

Nobody is perfect, so you may find some errors or small things to correct.
Please let me know if you think you found something that should be written
differently.

\section{Copyright}
\label{sec:copyright}

JVoiceXML uses the GNU library general public license~\cite{gnu:lgpg}. 
This is mentioned in all our source files as a unique header, see
section~\ref{sec:code-conventions}.
You can find a copy in the file \texttt{doc/copying.xhtml} in the \$\{JVOICEXML\_HOME\}
directory. This means that you are allowed to use JVoiceXML
library in your commercial programs. If you make some nice
enhancements it would be great, if you could share them
with us, e.g. by a pull request, so that we can make it available to the community.

JVoiceXML is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

\section{Download the Source Code}

\subsection{Download the Source Archive}

You can download a the source code for the available releases from 
\url{https://github.com/JVoiceXML/JVoiceXML/releases}. Parts of the source code
is part of the binary distribution and can be obtained by running the installer.
Although this works, it is not the recommended way. Please use the Git
repository as described in the following sections. 

\subsection{Git Repository}
\label{sec:git-repository}

If you want to stay at the current state of development you have to use
the Git repository from GitHub\footnote{\url{http://github.com}}. This is also
the preferred way. Some older stuff is still at Source Forge~\cite{sourceforge}.

This section describe the parameters to access the Git repository 
using the command line. Feel free to grab the required parameters from
this description and feed your favorite tool with them.

\begin{lstlisting}
git clone  https://github.com/JVoiceXML/JVoiceXML.git
\end{lstlisting}

This will check out all projects of JVoiceXML
into the folder \texttt{JVoiceXML}. Please refer to
section~\ref{sec:jvoicexml-core} if you want to checkout
only a minimal set of projects. Here, the required projects
to build the core project are marked as \emph{required}.

Since all the third party libraries are checked a checkout may
take a while.

A screenshot from a checkout in eclipse is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:eclipse-projects}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{eclipse-projects.png}
\caption{Eclipse project overview of JVoiceXML}
\label{fig:eclipse-projects}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Note:} UNIX file and directory names are case sensitive.

All projects follow the convention that they have the same name as the jar
that will be produced when bundling them. For instance, the jar \lstinline{org.jvoicexml.xml.jar}
is built by the project \lstinline{org.jvoicexm.xml}.

\section{Required Software}
\label{sec:required-software}

Since JVoiceXML is written in JAVA you will at least need a
JAVA compiler, see section~\ref{sec:ide}, an editor or preferably a JAVA
IDE, see section~\ref{sec:ide}, and Gradle, to build the
binaries. All used third party libraries can be downloaded from the CVS, SVN or
comparable repository or from their home pages. The file
\texttt{doc/libraries.xhtml} contains a list of all used libraries.


\subsection{IDE}
\label{sec:ide}

JVoiceXML is being developed using eclipse 4.6, but you can use the IDE of your
choice to edit the sources and compile the binaries. You can even use a simple
text editor to perform this job. Nevertheless there are some restriction that
you cannot work around.

Your IDE must support

\begin{itemize}
\item JavaSE 8
\item Gradle
\end{itemize}

\subsection{JAVA}
\label{sec:java}

Parts of the code of JVoiceXML are using features from the JAVA 8 API, so that
you will need at least JSE 8 to compile the code. You can download it
for free from \url{http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}.

In case you are using another IDE, you will have to manually adapt
the required library settings, e.g. gor code completion. The dependencies to all
libraries are listed in \lstinline{JVOICEXML_HOME/doc/libraries.xhtml}.


\subsubsection{Eclipse settings}
\label{sec:eclipse}

If you are not using eclipse as your favorite IDE, you may ignore this section.
We are using the \emph{Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers} version 4.6 (Neon))
for the development of JVoiceXML. The subversion repository contains the eclipse
project settings. This way, you there is no need to import the
project into eclipse. The project settings will be detected 
automatically when you checkout the projects. However you are requested to configure the execution
environment development for Java 8 \emph{JavaSE-1.8} to point to a valid JDK.
The use of execution environments makes the development independent of the
used version of the Java 8 SDK.

A screenshot for a possible configuration is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:eclipse-execution-environments}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{eclipse-execution-environments}
\caption{Configuration of the Java 8 Execution Environment in eclipse}
\label{fig:eclipse-execution-environments}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Required Eclipse Plug-ins for Development}

The development of JVoiceXML relies on some plug-ins that are not part of the
IDE. You will need to install the following eclipse plug-ins via the eclipse
Software Update mechanism.

Below is a list of the required update URLs.

\begin{description}
\item[Buildship] \url{https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship}
\item[Checkstyle] \url{http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/update} (Note that you
only need the 5.x version)
\item[TeXlipse] \url{http://texlipse.sourceforge.net} (optional if you want to
edit the documentation) This will also require an existing \LaTeX installation.
\item[Protocol Buffers Development Tools] \url{http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-dt/}
(optional if you want to edit the protobuf files in the sub project
\texttt{org.jvoicexml.mmi.events} or \texttt{org.jvoicexml.client.text})
\item[Microsoft Visual Studio 2019] \url{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/}
Only required, if you are running on Windows
\end{description}

However, the preferred way to install the plugins is via the eclipse market place.

\subsection{Gradle}
\label{sec:gradle}

JVoiceXML is being built by Gradle. It is recommended that
you use at least Gradle 3.0. 
If you don't have Gradle installed, you can download the current release
from \url{http://www.gradle.org}. This should not be necessary if Gradle is builtin
your IDE.

The build file allows you to override the settings by using a custom 
properties file \texttt{gradle.properties} in the \texttt{\$\{HOME\}/.gradle}
directory.

Since almost all IDEs feature support for Gradle, at least with the help of plugins, it will be possible to
use your favorite IDE.

\subsubsection{Gradle Support for Eclipse}
\label{sec:gradle-eclipse}

The Gradle project files are usually named \texttt{build.gradle} and reside the 
project root folder as well as in the folders of the subprojects. 
In order to run an Gradle target from within
eclipse you can use the \emph{Gradle Tasks} view as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:eclipse-run-gradle}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{eclipse-run-gradle}
\caption{Run a Gradle tasks from within Eclipse}
\label{fig:eclipse-run-gradle}
\end{figure}

This view is part of Eclipse's Buildship integration for Gradle.

\subsection{Tomcat}
\label{sec:tomcat}

For the system test and for some demos you will need to have a servlet
container installed. We use Tomcat 8 for that purpose. You can download this
release from \url{http://tomcat.apache.org}.

This is not needed if you do not use the servlet based demos or want to run the
system test.

\subsection{\LaTeX}

The documentation is being written using \LaTeX. If you want to edit the
documentation you will need to install a \LaTeX system like MiKTeX
\url{http://miktex.org} for windows or tetex on Linux systems.

This is not needed if you do not want to author the documentation or create a
distribution.

\section{Project Conventions}

JVoiceXML comprises several projects. Some of them are described in more
detail in the following section. All these projects follow some conventions
that should help to stay oriented.

The base namespace for all projects is \lstinline{org.jvoicexml}. Dependent 
projects may extend this namespace. For instance the namespace for the
XML library is \lstinline{org.jvoicexml.xml}.

The project names have the same name as the jar that they produce. This
makes it easier to find the project related to a specific Java archive.
For instance the project name for the XML library is
\lstinline{org.jvoicexml.xml}. It produces the jar
\texttt{org.jvoicexml.xml.jar}.
The drawback of this approach is that you will be confronted 
with a huge list of projects. The minimal set of projects
that are required to build JVoiceXML is marked in the list
given in section~\ref{sec:jvoicexml-core}.

The project names generally also reflect the overall architecture as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:main-components}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{main-components.png}
\caption{JVoiceXML general architecture}
\label{fig:main-components}
\end{figure}
These components can be mapped to the packages as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:main-packages}. Specializations mainfest as subpackages thereof.
For instance, the JSAPI 1.0 implementation platform resides in package 
\lstinline{org.jvoicexml.implementation.jsapi10} as a subpackage of
\lstinline{org.jvoicexml.implementation}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{main-packages.png}
\caption{Main pacakages of JVoiceXML}
\label{fig:main-packages}
\end{figure}


Within a project the following directory structure applies as suggested by
Gradle

\begin{description}
\item[build] compiled binaries
\item[src/main/java] Java source code
\item[src/main/resources] Additional resource files to be integrated in the Jar
\item[src/main/config] Project specific configuration files
\item[src/test/java] JUnit tests and other tests.
\item[src/test/resources]  Additional resource files for the tests
\item[build.gradle] Gradle build file
\ref{sec:create-configuration})
\end{description}

Demo projects may have an additional folder \texttt{config} to hold
configurations settings. 

\section{JVoiceXML Core}
\label{sec:jvoicexml-core}

The core of JVoiceXML comprises the following sub-projects:

\begin{description}
\item[org.jvoicexml] The core of the interpreter (required)

A simple demo to test that implementation platform is
\lstinline{org.jvoicexml.demo.text}.

\subsection{Project \texttt{main}}

This project is the core of the JVoiceXML browser and the central point of
building and configuring the environment.

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml}}


\subsubsection{Libraries Needed to Compile JVoiceXML}
\label{sec:libr-need-comp}

\begin{description}
\item[log4j] Version 1.2.17 \\
URL \url{http://logging.apache.org/log4j} \\
JVoiceXML uses log4j~\cite{apache:log4j} for logging. We think that log4j has 
some advantages
over \texttt{java.util.logging} and appears to be more mature and reliable.

The output of SUN's own logging framework can be redirected to log4j via the
system property
\begin{lstlisting}
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=${config}/logging.properties
\end{lstlisting}

This file contains the description of a logging handler that forwards all
request to log4j. Hence, both the log4j logging framework and SUN's logging
framework can be configured through the log4.xml configuration file.
\item[Jetty] Version 9.2.2 \\
URL\url{http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/} \\
Embedded web server to serve, e.g., generated grammar files.
\item[Commons Pool] Vesion 1.5.5 \\
URL \url{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/} \\
The pooling of implementation platform resources is based on commons
pool.
\item[Commons HTTP Client] Version 4.2.3 \\
URL \url{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/} \\
The HTTP client library is used to retrieve VoiceXML documents from a web
server.
\item[Commons HTTP Core] Version 4.2.3 \\
URL \url{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/} \\
Basic HTTP functionality for Commons HTTP Client.
\item[Commons Codec] Version 1.4 \\
URL \url{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/} \\
This library is required by the Commons HTTP Client to add attachments to the
POST and GET requests.
\item[Commons Lang] Version 3.3.2 \\
URL \url{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/} \\
Used by HTTP Core and Commons Pool.
\item[Commons Logging] Version 1.1.1 \\
URL \url{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/} \\
Used by HTTP Core and Commons Pool.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Libraries Needed at Run-time}

Besides the libraries named in section~\ref{sec:libr-need-comp} the following
libraries are needed to run JVoiceXML.

\subsubsection{Other Libraries}

Besides the libraries named above there are also other libraries in the
3rdparty folder. These libraries are used by more than one other implementation
platforms and are kept here as a general pool. Libraries that are used only by
one single implementation platform are located in the implementation platform's
3rdparty library directory.


\subsubsection{Creating a Configuration}
\label{sec:create-configuration}

Currently there are eleven implementations for the implementation platform
that reside in co-projects, refer to section~\ref{sec:git-repository}.

The file \texttt{\$JVOICEXML\_HOME/gradle.properties} contains templates for all
the switches and settings that may be used to enable or disable certain
implementation platforms or adapt needed configuration settings.

This adaptation should be done via your local copy of this file in your
local copy of that content at \texttt{gradle.properties} in
\texttt{\$HOME/.gradle}.

Once you changed the settings cd to the main subproject and call
\begin{lstlisting}
gradle run
\end{lstlisting}
to start the Voice Browser.
and stopped it by
\begin{lstlisting}
gradle shutdown
\end{lstlisting}

Please do not stop the voice browser by \texttt{CTRL-C} or similar. It may occur
that some resources are not closed properly and may cause conflicts with the next
start of JVoiceXML. This is because it is not possible to properly shutdown the
RMI registry.

The \texttt{build.gradle} also contains a target to enable remote
debugging. It can be called by
\begin{lstlisting}
gradle runDebug
\end{lstlisting}
The code will be compiled using your current configuration and the start of the
voice browser will be delayed until you connect with a remote debugger. The
used server port is 12367. This allows to set breakpoints using your IDE and
debug JVoiceXML.

\subsubsection{The Main Build File}
\label{sec:main-build-file}

This section explains the most important targets of the main build file
\texttt{build.gradle} in the main subproject. All others build files from the
implementation platforms
are called from this central point. Just start ant without any target specified
if you want to build everything. Call
\begin{lstlisting}
gradle tasks
\end{lstlisting}
to get an overview of the targets and their purpose.

\begin{description}
\item[clean]
Delete all compiled class files in the directory \emph{build}
and the jars that are created by the \emph{jar} target in the directory 
\emph{dist}.

\item[jar]
This target dcreates the jar files of your distribution.
If successful, you will find at minimum the following jar archives:
\begin{itemize}
\item org.jvoicexml.jar This jar file contains the core of JVoiceXML.
\item org.jvoicexml.xml.jar This jar contains all files that are required
to create and parse VoiceXML documents. This file is being build from the
project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.xml} which is described in
section~\ref{sec:org.jvoicexml.xml}.
\item jvxml-client.jar This jar contains the files needed to build
a client.
\item org.jvoicexml.jndi.jar JNDI support for JVoiceXML
\item some other jars, depending on your configuration settings
\end{itemize}

\item[javadoc]
Create JAVADOC documentation from the JAVA files in the directory.
\end{description}

Call
\begin{lstlisting}
gradle <target>
\end{lstlisting}
to run ant for the the given target.

The ANT launch configurations for eclipse are part of the Git repository. They
are available as a shortcut in the run. A screenshot is shown in figure~\ref{fig:eclipse-launch}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{eclipse-launch.png}
\caption{Run configuration for JVoiceXML}
\label{fig:eclipse-launch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.config}}
\label{sec:org.jvoicexml.config}

This project provides a library to configure JVoiceXML based on the spring
framework.
This is not required at run time and can be replaced by custom
implementations, e.g. to embed JVoiceXML. However, it is required to build
JVoiceXML.

This project has to be build after the main project.

\subsubsection{Third party libraries}
\label{sec:config-third-party-libr}

\begin{description}
\item[spring framework] Version 4.2.0 \\
URL \url{http://www.springsource.org} \\
Beans configuration as IoC 
\end{description}

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.xml}}
\label{sec:org.jvoicexml.xml}

This project provides an XML library to create and parse all VoiceXML related
XML languages like SRGSXML, PLS and SSML.

This project has to be build before the main project.

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.srgs}}
\label{sec:org.jvoicexml.srgs}

This project provides an SRGS processor.

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.interpreter.ecmascript}}
\label{sec:org.jvoicexml.srgs}

This project provides a datamodel based on ECMAscript.

\subsubsection{Third party libraries}
\label{sec:config-third-party-libr}

\begin{description}
\item[Rhino] Version 1.7Rv \\
URL \url{http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/} \\
JVoiceXML uses Rhino from Mozilla to enable scripting.
\item[JSONsimple] Version 1.1 \\
URL \url{http://code.google.com/p/json-simple} \\
Helps to serialize and deserialize JSON formatted strings into ECMAscript.
\end{description}

\section{Remote Java Applications}
\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.client}}

This project contains the basic classes that are needed to implement a
client that can connect remotely to JVoiceXML.

\subsubsection{Third party libraries}

This platform makes use of the \lstinline{org.jvoicexml.jndi} library
to connect to JVoiceXML (see section\ref{sec:jndi}). In addition specialized
libraries from the implementation platform (see section
\ref{sec:implementation-platforms}) maybe required.

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.jndi}}
\label{sec:jndi}

This project provides JNDI support for JVoiceXML. This is not required at run
time but in order to build JVoiceXML.

JNDI offers remote access to JVoiceXML, e.g. the ability to run the
shutdown script or to run the demos.

The project settings for this subproject can be adapted by the following ANT
properties in your copy of the \texttt{ant.properties} file in the
\texttt{personal-props} folder of the core project (see 
section~\ref{sec:adapt-ant}):
\begin{lstlisting}
jvxml.jndi.repository=text
jvxml.jndi.port=1099
\end{lstlisting}

The configuration ANT script also adapts the settings in the
\texttt{jndi.properties} to the configured port. Make sure to also adapt
the \texttt{jndi.properties} in the demos or your application.

The repository entry must match the repository that you are using for your
client. Otherwise JVoiceXML will not be able to load the needed resources of
the server side.

\section{Implementation Platforms}
\label{sec:implementation-platforms}

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.implementation.jsapi10}}
\label{sec:implementation-jsapi10}

This project provides an implementation platform for JSAPI 1.0 compliant
speech engines. Besides a general hook for those engines there are also
extensions for FreeTTS and Sphinx 4 bases on these hooks to demonstrate the
capabilities.

\subsubsection{Project Specific Configuration}

The project settings for this subproject can be adapted by the following
properties in the \texttt{platforms.xml}

\begin{description}
\item[jvxml.jsapi10.talkingJava] If set to
\texttt{true} the Talking Java wrapper for Microsoft's speech engine will be
used. In this case you need also to specifiy a value for
\texttt{jvxml.jsapi10.talkingJava.path}
\item[jvxml.jsapi10.talkingJava.path] A path that is used to locate the DLLs
that are required to use Talking Java as sthe speech engine.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Third party libraries}
\label{sec:jsapi10-third-party-libr}

\begin{description}
\item[JSAPI 1.0] Version 1.0 \\
URL n/a \\
Java Speech API v1.0 (JSAPI)~\cite{sun:jsapi} to address speech recognition and
speech synthesis issues. It is a pure API layer without any concrete TTS or ASR
implementations which have to be added in addition. 
\item[Talking Java] Version n/a \\
URL \url{http://www.cloudgarden.com} \\
Talking Java is an implementation of the JSAPI 1.0 utilizing Microsoft's
SAPI4 and SAPI5 speech engines. Note that the delivered version is only free
for personal use. If you intend to use it in a commercial corporate or
institutional context, you will have to buy a license. 
Please refer to \url{http://www.cloudgarden.com}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.implementation.jsapi20}}
\label{sec:implementation-jsapi20}

This project contains a first draft of an implementation platform to enable
JSAPI 2.0 support for JVoiceXML.

\subsubsection{Project Specific Configuration}

The project settings for this subproject can be adapted by the following
properties in the \texttt{platforms.xml}

\begin{description}

\subsection{Project \texttt{org.jvoicexml.implementation.mrcpv2}}

This implementation platform aims at MRCPv2 support for JVoiceXML. It is in the
starting phase and currently it is not usable.

This implementation platform requires the presence of an MRCPv2 server. An open
source solution based on FreeTTS and sphinx 4 can be downloaded from
\url{http://cairo.sourceforge.net}.

To make use of this implementation platform, JVoiceXML must be called with a SIP
phone. We used the xlite phone which can be downloaded for free from
\url{http://www.counterpath.com}.

\subsubsection{Project Specific Configuration}

This component is an approach to establish unit testing capabilities for
VoiceXML.

\section{System test}

The system test implements the W3C's conformance test for VoiceXML 2.1.

\begin{description}
\item[org.jvoicexml.voicexmlunit] VoiceXML unit test framewortk
\item[org.jvoicexml.voicexmlunit] Demo test project
\end{description}

In addition you will need the following sub-projects:
\begin{itemize}
\item org.jvoicexml
\item org.jvoicexml.xml
\item org.jvoicexml.client
\item org.jvoicexml.client.text
\item org.jvoicexml.implementation.text
\end{itemize} 

\section{Documentation}

The documentation comprise the following sub-projects:

\begin{description}
\item[howtobuild] The how to build JVoiceXML documentation (this document)
\item[userguide] A tutorial to start working with JVoiceXML
\item[htdocs] The HTML web pages
\end{description}

Both guides are written in \LaTeX and you will need to have a \LaTeX compiler
installed. For Windows, MiKTeX as mentioned above is an option.


\section{Code Conventions}
\label{sec:code-conventions}

We follow the JAVA code conventions~\cite{sun:codeconv} for our code. All
methods and member variables must be commented using 
JAVADOC~\cite{sun:javadoc_guidelines}.

In addition we use a \texttt{TODO} tag to mark sections that need further work.

Example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
// TODO Implement the untreated case XYZ
\end{lstlisting}

We use checkstyle~\cite{checkstyle} to check our coding conventions.
All developers are requested to execute the \emph{checkstyle} target
of our ANT buildfile, see section~\ref{sec:main-build-file}. 
There are plug-ins for some IDEs, which you can use if you want to. The
\texttt{checkstyle.xml} can be found in the folder 
\texttt{etc} and is called \texttt{jvoicexml-checks.xml}.

With the help of the checkstyle plugin these tests can be run automatically
and visualized inside eclipse. Therefore, each project has to be configured to
use this project relative configuration file. A screenshot is shown inside
figure~\ref{fig:eclipse-project-checkstyle}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{eclipse-project-checkstyle.png}
\caption{Project relative configuration of checkstyle within eclipse}
\label{fig:eclipse-project-checkstyle}
\end{figure}


Developers are requested to use the \texttt[language=Java]{@inheritDoc}
JAVADOC tag in favor of a \texttt[language=Java]{@see} reference for inherited documentation.
Pros of the \texttt[language=Java]{@inheritDoc} tag, taken 
from~\cite{tauber:inheritdoc}, are
\begin{itemize}
\item satisfies checkstyle requirements for JAVADOC,
\item no references to go stale,
\item additional doc specific to this implementation will appear in JAVADOC and
\item inherited doc in JAVADOC.
\end{itemize}

All source files must contain the following header about the 
copyright, see section~\ref{sec:copyright}, that we use for JVoiceXML.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
/*
 * JVoiceXML - A free VoiceXML implementation.
 *

 *
 */
\end{lstlisting}

The class comment has to contain the following information:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]

/**
 * Comment about the purpose of this class.
 *
 * @author <Name of the author>
 * @author <Other authors>
 * @since <current version number>
 */
\end{lstlisting}

The name of the author and the purpose have to be replaced by their proper
values.

\section{Releases}

This section describes the required steps to create a new release for
JVoice\-XML.

\subsection{Creation of a Release Workspace}

New releases are \emph{never} built from the workspace to ensure that there are
no changes in the workspace that are not reflected in the SVN repository.
Therefore change to an empty directory and copy the following files from the
\texttt{org.jvoicexml} project to this new folder:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item nightly.xml
  \item all jars from the \texttt{3rdparty/svnant/lib} folder
\end{enumerate}
Open a command prompt at this directory and call
\begin{lstlisting}
ant -f nightly.xml checkout
\end{lstlisting}

The next step is to adjust you local settings. This can easily be done by
copying the contents of the personal-props directory of your development copy
of JVoiceXML to the personal-props directory of the new copy.


\subsection{Unit Tests}

There are many unit tests based on JUnit to ensure the correctness of the
classes written for JVoiceXML. Some tests need customized settings, e.g. to
start the Mary TTS server. These settings are maintained in the file
\texttt{config-props/test.properties} and can be overridden with a
personalized copy in the folder \texttt{personal-props}.

The unit tests are started from the core project
\texttt{org.jvoicexml}. It is the entry point of the unit tests of the various subproject. Therefore, change to the core directory of the release copy and call
\begin{lstlisting}
cd org.jvoicexml
ant -f nightly.xml unittests
\end{lstlisting}
This will take some time. The results of the unit tests of all sub-projects can
be viewed using your favorite web browser by opening
\texttt{org.jvoicexml/dist/unittests/html/index.html} after the tests are
finished. There must not be any errors or failures in the summary. Note that
some tests require an active Internet connection. 

If you detect any errors correct identify the cause for it, correct them
yourself or contact the responsible developer of the module. After the errors
have been fixed, restart from the beginning to make a new release.

\subsection{Create the Distribution}

After the unit test ran successfully, the binary distribution can be built. The
ANT script \texttt{distribution.xml} contains the needed targets.
Update the version number in the file \texttt{config-props/ant.properties}
and comment the version number in the copy in the folder
\texttt{personal-props}. The JVoiceXML version number consists of
\begin{lstlisting}
 <major-version>.<minor-version>.<bug-fix-level>.<EA|GA>
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{E}arly \textbf{A}ccess (EA) versions are intended for intermediate
versions while \textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}vailability (GA) versions are the
main versions that are available for download via the SourceForge file
downloads.

Create a distribution configuration by calling
\begin{lstlisting}
ant -f configuration createDistributionConfiguration
\end{lstlisting}

Call
\begin{lstlisting}
ant -f distribution.xml
\end{lstlisting}
to create the release. Make sure that the Javadoc output does not show any
errors. In case there are errors, correct them and repeat the creation of the
distributable.

All intermediate files are stored in the folder \texttt{dist/version}. The
distributable can be found in the folder of the core project after the
executing the ANT target.

\subsection{Test the Installation}

Run the installer to install the created distribution.
\begin{lstlisting}
java -jar jvxml-install-<version>.jar
\end{lstlisting}
Select all available packages and test the installation. 
Copy the jsapi2.jar to the lib folder of the installed version.
Start the voice browser and check if there are any errors in the log when
JVoiceXML starts.

Uninstall JVoiceXML and reinstall it with the JSAPI 1.0 implementation platform
only and the demos. Start JVoiceXML and check if all demos are working properly.
It should not be necessary to restart JVoiceXML while the demos are tested.

If any error occurs while testing, locate the cause of the error, fix it
yourself or identify the person who is responsible for the module and restart
the release process from the beginning.

\subsection{Tag the Release}

Commit the ANT properties file with the new version number.

The next step serves to tag the code of the release version. Therefore, you
will have to supply values for the properties
\begin{lstlisting}
svn.username=
svn.password=
\end{lstlisting}
in the ANT properties in the folder \texttt{personal-props}.

Call
\begin{lstlisting}
ant -f distribution.xml tag
\end{lstlisting}
to create copies of the source code in the SVN folder
\begin{lstlisting}
.../<subproject>/tags/<version>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Upload the Distribution}

The upload comprises two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Javadoc upload
  \item Release upload
\end{enumerate}

Uploading requires the following properties in your personal copy of the ANT
properties:
\begin{lstlisting}
nightly.sf.user=
nightly.sf.password=
\end{lstlisting}

In order to upload the Javadoc, you first have to create the
destination folder at SourceForge. The name of the folder is
\begin{lstlisting}
/home/groups/j/jv/jvoicexml/htdocs/api/<version>
\end{lstlisting}
Make sure that the group can write the new folder and that other can access it.
The generated documentation can be copied by executing
\begin{lstlisting}
ant -f distribution.xml uploadJavadoc
\end{lstlisting}

The release is uploaded by 
\begin{lstlisting}
ant -f distribution.xml upload
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Update of the Website}

The web site needs some adaption to point to the new release when users click
on the download link. The download links can be found at the page
\texttt{downloads.html} in the project \texttt{htdocs}. Update the link
to the new release and commit the changes.

\subsection{Prepare the Further Development}

Prepare the next version by incrementing th version number in the ANT
properties file in the folder \texttt{config-props} and committing that file.

\subsection{Creation of Snapshots for Maven}

Some subprojects are ready to be upload snapshots for Maven to
Sonatype\footnote{\url{http://www.sonatype.com}}. Sonatype offers
a free repository hosting service using Nexus for open soource projects.

Therefore deployers are requested to sign up for their servie. Detailed
instructions are given at \url{https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide}.

Create the file \texttt{settings.xml} in the \texttt{.m2} folder in your
home directory with the following contents:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
         http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
      <username>your user name</username>
      <password>your password</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
      <username>your user name</username>
      <password>your password</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
\end{lstlisting}

Insert your user name and your password at the marked entries.
Afterwards call 
\begin{lstlisting}
ant -f distribution.xml dist-maven-snapshot
\end{lstlisting}
in the core project \lstinline{org.jvoicexml}.

The snapshots will use the SVN version number to differentiate between different
snapshots of the same jar. Consequently, you will have to have at least
a commit between two snapshots.
