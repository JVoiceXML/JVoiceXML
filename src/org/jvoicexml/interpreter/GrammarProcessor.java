     * Give in grammar into this processor and let it do it's job.
     *
     * <p>
     * Ok, to be a more specific, here is a short briefing, what is
     * done to the grammar:
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * First of all, the grammar node is going to be walked along to
     * check it's attributes and children. If it has a "src" attribut
     * as well as an inline grammar an "error.badfetch" is thrown.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * External grammars referenced by the src attribute as well as
     * external rule expansions are going to be fetched. This is done
     * in a loop until all external grammars are loaded.<br>
     * While fetching all grammars one by one, the type and language
     * is going to be checked.<br>
     * If a unsupported grammar type is referenced an
     * "UnsupportedFormatError" is thrown.<br>
     * If a grammar for an unsupported language is fetched
     * "UnsupportedLanguageError" is thrown.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * When there are no more external rule expansions, it is time to
     * convert the grammar into a form, which can be passed to a JSAPI
     * compliant ASR Engine. JSAPI 1.0 specifies that any compliant
     * ASR engine must be able to process grammars in the JSGF Form.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * To provide support for a wide range of grammars, it is possible
     * to create your own grammar transformer. The appropriate
     * transformer for the actual grammar is selected from a list of
     * registered <code>GrammarTransformer</code>. The resulting
     * <code>RuleGrammar</code> object is wrapped in a
     * <code>Scopable</code> object. The object is passed into a
     * container to make sure, the grammar can be activated at the
     * right time.<br>
     * After this, the method returns.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param context
     *        The current context.
     * @param attributes
     *        attributes governing the fetch.
     * @param grammar
     *        The grammar to process
     * @param grammars
     *        The used grammar registry.
     * @exception NoresourceError
     *         Error accessing the input device.
     * @throws UnsupportedFormatError
     *         If an unsupported grammar has to be processed.
     * @throws BadFetchError
     *         If the document could not be fetched successfully.
