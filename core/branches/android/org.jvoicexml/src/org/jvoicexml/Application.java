 * An <code>Application</code> is a set of documents sharing the same

 * Whenever the user interacts with a document in an application, its
 * application root document is also loaded. The application root document
 * remains loaded while the user is transitioning between other documents in the
 * same application, and it is unloaded when the user transitions to a document
 * that is not in the application. While it is loaded, the application root
 * document's variables are available to the other documents as application
 * variables, and its grammars remain active for the duration of the
 * application.
