Use the file jvoicexml.geany as the project file if you like to work
with Geany as the IDE.

You may have to edit the base path to point to the checkout folder.
base_path=/home/raphael/development/jvoicexml/

Copy the complete folder .config/ (with the subfolder geany) into your
home directory to have nice settings for Geany with java and ant,
e.g. my home is /home/raphael/
