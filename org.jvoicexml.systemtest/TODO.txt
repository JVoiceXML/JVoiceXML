1. Need find some ideas to resolve how to feed back suitable answer for each test case. 

1.1 Add script class to control test executor response jvxml. 
    It's not clear and simple solution  based on jvxml output 
    or test.vxml template. There are need to cover so many conditions.
	
1.2 Analysis TXML file, hope it is possible that auto create answer script for IR 
    tests mostly.
    
1.3 For each test case , Script factory do follow as order:
	1) check ignore.xml, if there are record this test case, skip. 
	2) check whether the scripts directory has a script for this test case, if exists, 
	   perform it. else,
	3) use default script, it included a GuessAnswerAction.

2. Network resource has not be released. No more free socket, when run several times.

3. Document's xmlBase not be set, when do multi-document test.  
S. Resolved. Will send to Dirk as a BUG. 
 
4. Need to collect Log Tag output.
S. finished.

5. Need to collect input/output records.
S. cancel. if need lookup input/output records, see local log.

6. It can not handle test fail. The failed test would effect next test.

6.1 Write a test for discover why session.waitSessionEnd() was never 
    return, when call session.hangup() at some condition.
S.  unit test finished. but now, replace by listen TextServer connect/disconnect message.

6.2 May be there are  had a bug in TestServer. When thread throw IOException, thread 
    can not go to back accept next client connect request. So, the next test case always fail.

7. Need to check whether interpreter log have ERROR or high level log.
S. finished. As report output.
