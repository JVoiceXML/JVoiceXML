/**
 * Facade for easy access to the system output.
 *
 * <p>
 * Objects that implement this interface support audio output using audio files
 * and text-to-speech (TTS). They are able to freely sequence TTS and audio
 * output.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an audio output resource is not available, an
 * <code>error.noresource</code> event is thrown. Audio files are referred to
 * by a URI. The language specifies a required set of audio file formats which
 * must be supported; additional audio file formats may also be supported.
