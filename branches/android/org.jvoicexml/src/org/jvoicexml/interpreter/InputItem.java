/**
 * Implementation of a input item. Main purpose of this class is to allow a
 * distinction between <em>input</em> items and <em>control</em> items.
 *
 * <p>
 * An input item specifies an <em>input item variable</em> to gather input
 * from the user. Input items have prompts to tell the user what to say or key
 * in, grammars that define the allowed inputs, and event handlers that process
 * any resulting events. An input item may also have a
 * <code>&lt;filled&gt;</code> element that defines an action to take just
 * after the input item variable is filled.
 * </p>
