/**
 * A session begins when the user starts to interact with a VoiceXML interpreter
 * context, continues as documents are loaded and processed, and ends when
 * requested by the user, a document, or the interpreter context.
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>Session</code> can be obtained via the
 * <code>JVoiceXml.createSession()</code> method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A client usually performs the following method calls to interact with
 * the interpreter:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #call(URI) call}</li>
 * <li>{@link #hangup() hangup}</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The call method returns immediately. In case of an error the client
 * does not get notified. In order to monitor the call and retrieve error
 * messages, clients should use the {@link #waitSessionEnd() waitSessionEnd}
 * method. This may be done synchronously right after the
 * <code>call</code> method call or asynchronously in a thread.
 * </p>
