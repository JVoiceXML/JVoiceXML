 * Facade for easy control and monitoring of the user's input.
 *
 * <p>
 * Objects that implement this interface are able to detect and report character
 * and/or spoken input simultaneously and to control input detection interval
 * duration with a timer whose length is specified by a VoiceXML document.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an input resource is not available, an <code>error.noresource</code>
 * event must be thrown.
