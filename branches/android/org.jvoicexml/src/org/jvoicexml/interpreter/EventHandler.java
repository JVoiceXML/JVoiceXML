/**
 * Event handler to catch events generated from the
 * {@link org.jvoicexml.ImplementationPlatform} and propagated via
 * {@link #notifyEvent(org.jvoicexml.event.JVoiceXMLEvent)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * When an event is thrown, the scope in which the event is handled and its
 * enclosing scopes are examined to find the best qualified catch element,
 * according to the following algorithm:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Form an ordered list of catches consisting of all catches in the current
 * scope and all enclosing scopes (form item, form, document, application root
 * document, interpreter context), ordered first by scope (starting with the
 * current scope), and then within each scope by document order.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Remove from this list all catches whose event name does not match the event
 * being thrown or whose <code>cond</code> evaluates to false after conversion
 * to boolean.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Find the <em>correct count</em>: the highest count among the catch elements
 * still on the list less than or equal to the current count value.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Select the first element in the list with the <em>correct count</em>.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The name of a thrown event matches the catch element event name if it is
 * an exact match, a prefix match or if the catch event attribute is not
 * specified (note that the event attribute cannot be specified as an empty
 * string - event="" is syntactically invalid). A prefix match occurs when the
 * catch element event attribute is a token prefix of the name of the event
 * being thrown, where the dot is the token separator, all trailing dots are
 * removed, and a remaining empty string matches everything.
 * </p>
