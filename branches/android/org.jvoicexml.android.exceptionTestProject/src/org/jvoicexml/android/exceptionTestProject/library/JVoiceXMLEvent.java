/**
 * Base class for all events.
 *
 * <p>
 * The platform throws events when the user does not respond, doesn't respond in
 * a way that the application understands, requests help, etc. The interpreter
 * throws events if it finds a semantic error in a VoiceXML document, or when it
 * encounters a <code>&lt;throw&gt;</code> element. Events are identified by
 * character strings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Events are subdivided into plain events (things that happen normally), and
 * error events (abnormal occurrences).
