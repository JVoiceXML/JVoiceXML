# JVoiceXML
Open Source VoiceXML interpter

A free VoiceXML interpreter for JAVA with an open architecture for custom extensions. Demo implementation platforms are supporting JAVA APIs such as JSAPI and JTAPI.

JVoiceXML is an implementation of VoiceXML 2.1, the Voice Extensible Markup Language, specified at http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21/. This is an extension to VoiceXML 2.0, specified at http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/

VoiceXML is designed for creating audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations. Major goal is to have a platform independent implementation that can be used for free.
