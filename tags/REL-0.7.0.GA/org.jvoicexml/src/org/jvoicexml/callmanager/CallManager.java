 * Manager for telephony integration.

 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * manage a mapping of terminals to an URI of the starting document of an
 * application through the {@link ConfiguredApplication}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * maintain a list of {@link Terminal}s as an interface to the telephony
 * environment

 * The {@link CallManager} is started asynchronously via the {@link #start()}
 * method when JVoiceXML starts. The {@link CallManager} starts as a server,
 * waiting for incoming connections, e.g. from a PBX. Once a call arrives
 * it creates a {@link org.jvoicexml.Session} using the {@link JVoiceXml}
 * reference that is delivered via the {@link #setJVoiceXml(JVoiceXml)} method.
