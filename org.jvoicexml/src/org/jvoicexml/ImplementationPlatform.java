/**
 * The <em>implementation platform</em> is controlled by the VoiceXML
 * interpreter context and by the VoiceXML interpreter.
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation platform generates events in response to user actions
 * (e.g. spoken or character input received, disconnect) and system events (e.g.
 * timer expiration). Some of these events are acted upon the VoiceXML
 * interpreter itself, as specified by the VoiceXML document, while others are
 * acted upon by the VoiceXML interpreter context.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * External resources are considered to be in a pool. The implementation
 * platform is able to retrieve them from the pool and push them back.
 * This means that all resources that have benn borrowed from the
 * implementation platform must be returned to it if they are no longer used.
